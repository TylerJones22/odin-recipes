    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chiles rellenos—Mexican-style stuffed and fried peppers in a roasted-tomato salsa—was 
        one of the very first dishes I learned how to cook, using the method that my dad taught me. 
        It mostly involved cans. I'm pretty sure that the only reason we used canned chilies back then 
        is that it wasn't possible to get good fresh Poblano peppers in New York in the early '80s. 
        That's not a problem anymore (and certainly not an issue near my current home in the Bay Area), 
        and both my recipe and my technique have improved since those early can-based days. I've experimented 
        with various chili-roasting methods and dozens of batter recipes and techniques, and I've finally 
        nailed that salsa. Here's what I've learned.</p>
