    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        There's nothing else too unusual about my recipe, other than the fact that I 
        finish it with a bit of fish sauce in order to up the umami. 
        Don't worry, it won't taste fishy. You could get similar results by adding a couple smashed anchovies and a 
        half teaspoon of marmite in with the vegetables in the second step. 
    </p>

        Hand-rolled pasta works great, but the no-boil flat noodles are surprisingly 
        good—almost as good as the real deal, particularly because with a 40 minute 
        cooking time, even with fresh pasta, al dente is not the final goal. The pasta 
        in a good lasagna should be soft, tender, and intensely flavored with the soaked-up 
        liquid from the ragù.  
    </p>

        Quick tip: Want to make quick and easy meaty cannelloni instead? Simply soak the 
        no-boil noodles in 4 or 5 changes of really hot water until they soften up. Roll 
        them up around a mixture of ricotta, eggs, and mozzarella, top with sauce and more 
        cheese, bake at 350 until bubbly, and you're done.
